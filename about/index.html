      <p class="ex2", style="margin-left:2.5em; color:cadetblue;"> My research </p>


      <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> I am a theoretical astrophysicist interested in the characterization of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. My work focuses on trying to understand more
				about these exciting objects by modeling their flux and <a href="/polarization/" style="color:goldenrod"> polarization </a> spectra and mapping their
				atmospheres (and potentially surfaces). I am an Assistant Professor in the Physics department at the University of Central Florida. </p>


				<p class="ex1", style="margin-left:2.5em",  style="margin-top:1em"> <strong> How do we characterize these atmospheres? </strong> </p>

				<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> 	With thousands of exoplanets and brown dwarfs detected to date, our goal has shifted from ‘just’ detecting
					more of these atmospheres to also trying to characterize them. By characterizing these atmospheres we try to answer a number of questions
					such as: Are there clouds in these atmospheres, and if so, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...826....8Y/abstract" style="color:blue"> where </a>
					are these clouds and how are they organized (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...814...65K/abstract" style="color:blue"> spots </a> or
					<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Sci...357..683A/abstract" style="color:blue"> bands </a> )? If
					there are clouds, how do they	<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...825...90K/abstract" style="color:blue"> change over time </a>  and what does that tell us about the atmospheric dynamics of our targets?  Does the age,
					metallicity, gravity or another parameter affect how these atmospheres look like? </p>


				<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> But how do we characterize a one-pixel atmosphere? To do that we compare our observational spectra (or photometry)
					with model spectra (photometry). Comparing our observations with a grid of models with different temperatures, gravities, cloud content etc, we
					find which model fits best our observations, and thus what the properties of the observed atmosphere are. </p>
		    
		    
				<p class="ex1", style="margin-left:2.5em",  style="margin-top:1em"> <strong> Why maps? </strong> </p>

				<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> Directly Imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets currently, and terrestrial exoplanets in the future, are just
					a pixel wide in our images. That pixel contains all the information on the atmosphere and (potentially) surface properties of our target. So
					how can we know whether our target has continents, oceans and patchy clouds like the Earth, a Great Red Spot like Jupiter or a cloud decked
					atmosphere like Venus? The solution to our problem is using time resolved observations, i.e., when we observe our target as it revolves around
					its axis. The disk-integrated light we receive from the (pixel-wide) target will vary as the target revolves around its axis due to different
					atmospheric and surface formations moving in and out of our field of view. The variation of the light curve, i.e., the light we receive from
					the target as it revolves around its axis, can thus be used as a tool to map the atmosphere (and possible surface) of the planet. With this
					in mind I developed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04251" style="color:blue"> Aeolus </a>, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo code that can map the atmosphere of
					our target, and its evolution over time, using observed light curves. </p>

		       <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> The existence of different species in an atmosphere like H2O, CH4 etc, with different vertical 
			       profiles, results in different amounts of light being absorbed at different wavelengths, and different pressures reached when we reach the 
			       center of an absorption line. Observing an atmosphere at different wavelengths allows 
			       us to probe different pressure layers in an atmosphere (see figure below). Hubble Space Telescope observations for example can give us the map 
			       of a brown dwarf atmosphere like Luhman 16B at deeper levels in the J-band, and higher up in the atmosphere in the H2O-band.  </p>

			       <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em">  Using high resolution observations from the ground (or with JWST) we could use alkali lines like, 
				      for example, KI to map different layers in the atmosphere with different cloud structures in them. Indeed, high-resolution observations with 
				       <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12368.pdf" style="color:blue"> MOSFIRE </a> showed that the KI line changes differently than the continuum 
		                     which could be due to different cloud configuration affecting the higher layers which KI is sensitive to. </p>

		                                The Holy Grail of the field of exoplanets is to find Earth 2.0, an other planet that like Earth can host life on its surface.
						A key ingredient to life as we know it, is liquid water. We thus classify as habitable, planets that have the appropriate conditions to have liquid water
						on their surface. The existence of liquid water on the surface of an exoplanet can be indirectly inferred by the presence of liquid water on the exoplanet
						atmosphere. </p>

<p class="ex3", style="margin-left:3.5em",  style="margin-top:5em"> </p>
		    
					<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> One of the ways we can detect liquid water clouds on an exoplanet atmosphere is with the use of polarimetric observations.
						The power of polarimetry in the characterization of an exoplanetary atmosphere was already shown over 40 years ago, with the retrieval of  the cloud top
						pressure, composition and size distribution of cloud droplets in the upper Venusian atmosphere using ground-based, unresolved observations of Venus
						by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974JAtS...31.1137H/abstract" style="color:blue"> Hansen & Hovenier (1974) </a>. Polarimetric observations are a powerful tool
						that helps increase the planet-to-star contrast ratio, making it easier to directly detect an exoplanet, and that allows us to detect liquid water clouds
						on the exoplanetary atmosphere by allowing the detection of the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...530A..69K/abstract" style="color:blue"> rainbow </a> of
						the liquid water clouds. </p>


						<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> During my PhD in SRON and Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands I have worked on developing a radiative transfer code that
							models the flux and polarization spectra of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3198" style="color:blue"> terrestrial </a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1161" style="color:blue"> giant </a>
							exoplanets with heterogeneous cloud and, when applicable, surface coverage.  You can get
							an open-access copy of my thesis <a href="https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/20830" style="color:blue"> here </a>. </p>

						<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> Simulating terrestrial exoplanets with heterogeneous liquid and ice cloud coverage with
							various configurations, my collaborators and I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1293" style="color:blue"> showed </a> that the
							rainbow is a robust tool, that can be used to detect liquid water clouds on an exoplanet, even when optically thick
							ice clouds exist on the exoplanet atmosphere! Using MODIS observations from April 25th 2011 we simulated the
							Earth-as-an-exoplanet and showed that an alien observer could detect the
							existence of liquid water clouds if he/she/it was using polarimetric observations! </p>

						<p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em"> Of course, theory needs always data to back it up. To test whether the rainbow is
							indeed observable in the exoplanet-Earth signal we have proposed to create <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0209" style="color:blue"> LOUPE </a>,
							a small and robust polarimeter that can observe the Earth as if it were an exoplanet from the Moon. </p>

		                                         Polarization is also a useful tool to characterize brown dwarf 
							 atmospheres. Some brown dwarf atmospheres have a wealth of clouds in their atmospheres but as they 
							 are hotter than the Earth or Jupiter they emit most of their light in the infrared. The polarization expected 
							 from such an atmosphere is lower than what we would expected for reflected star light 
							 (see <a href="/polarization/" style="color:goldenrod"> polarization </a> for more details) but, recently, 
							 instruments became sensitive enough to detect it! </p>
		    
		                                    <p style="margin-left:2.5em; margin-right:2.5em",  style="margin-top:1em"> Using such a sensitive polarimeter to observe Luhman 16AB,

							 clouds (like Jupiter's) on 16A. This was the first time that such an indirect detection of bands was possible 
							 with the help of polarization. Recently, I PIed a proposal that was awarded Hubble Space Telescope time to 
							 observe Luhman 16AB over a number of continuous rotations to directly detect these bands. If the existence of banded clouds is confirmed, 
							 polarization will offer a great (and cheaper) tool for detecting bands on exoatmospheres, and prioritizing them 
							 for characterization through follow-up (more expensive) space telescope observations.
